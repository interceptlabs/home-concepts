# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-23)

**Core value:** A visitor never faces a wall of text — content is revealed as needed, and clicking an area of interest takes them to a focused page built from that content.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Content Foundation & Shared Brand Layer

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Content Foundation & Shared Brand Layer)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-23 — ROADMAP.md and STATE.md created; all 25 v1 requirements mapped across 5 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phases 2, 3, 4 (Concepts A, B, C) each depend only on Phase 1, not on each other — architecture keeps concepts fully isolated (share only `content/` and `shared/`), enabling parallel builds per config.json `parallelization: true`.
- Roadmap: Concept sequencing follows ascending implementation risk (A editorial lowest, B video self-contained-medium, C WebGL highest) per research recommendation, even though all three could build in parallel.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Concept B): the exact progressive-reveal mechanism (scroll-scrubbed chaptered video vs. ambient loop + hotspot vs. click-to-reveal panel) is not yet settled — research flags this for `/gsd:discuss-phase 3` before build.
- Phase 4 (Concept C): the specific 3D interaction metaphor (orbit/click-object scene vs. scroll-driven camera fly-through vs. Spline-authored scene) is not yet settled — research flags this for `/gsd:discuss-phase 4` before build.
